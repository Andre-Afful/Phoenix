# Data Quality Assessment Project.

The aim of this project is to help appreciate the principles of data quality.

It is divided into these 3 tasks:
  * Data profiling
  * Define quality rules
  * Create quality checks


## Data Overview

Set up MSSQL to create a local version of the database. Download here [SQL Server Downloads|Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads)

Download the .bak file of the database using this link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S4-NSIWUHg7rVC33ad6022fwz5_1Vn36/view

A link to the [Data Dictionary](https://azubiafrica-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/clifford_akai-nettey_azubiafrica_org/EbykO--7BuNOt7cBMH_8tnQBNqhpDiw2SdE7wr5BV3lLGg?e=qFmDNs)


## Task 1: Data Profiling

At this stage you want to answer some of the following questions:
  * How many columns are present? What are their data types? Number of values?
  * Are they missing data?
  * Are there invalid data?
  * Are there blanks?

*Further questions are based on your discretion, use the resources for more information

Output:
    * An SQL script that profiles the Equador Data 
    * A screenshot of a dashboard or a presentation that displays all of the information about the profile of the data


## Task 2: Define Quality Rules

Based on the output of the of the first task yoy can draft quality rules that could govern how the Equador data should be handled.

Output:
    * A document that outlines how you would measure quality in the Equador data.


## Task 3: Create Quality Checks 

Based on the qulaity rules defined create quality checks that can be applied to the data.

Output:
    * An SQL script that logs problems identified into an audit_log table
